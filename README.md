# 🐾 Neco Ping

**Minimalistic, silent Telegram notifier for your weary ML pipelines.**  
*Because your model training takes forever, nya!* 😺💤

---

`neco_ping` is a tiny, fire-and-forget Python library designed for data scientists and ML engineers who just want a notification when their 10-hour training job is done (or crashed). No polling, no async loops, no complex bot setup—just one simple `post` request.

If the internet is down or the Telegram API is grumpy, `neco_ping` stays silent and won't crash your precious script. Safety first, nya!

## 📦 Installation

Install it via pip (once I publish it, nya!):

```bash
pip install neco_ping
